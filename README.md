# Kolumn

Kolumn is a platform for writers to share their work on Blockchain.
It basically means they make their work immutable, and share it in it's purest form without any censorship.
Another thing which makes Kolumn applealing to writers is the fact that they truly own their work, no central authorization is making money out of it, there are no ads, no spyware, it's just pure content.
Users can support Authors by sending them crypto-currency which again is done without cutting any perchantage from the transaction (Other than network fee).
